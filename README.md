# FEUP Jobs

## Vision Stament

For FEUP students who are finishing their course looking for a job and for anyone looking for a job at FEUP. FEUP Jobs is an app that allows the user to interact with FEUP's job database. Unlike SIGARRA, our product will have a pleasing UI that also contributes towards improving the user experience.

## Main Features

- Display all the jobs posted at FEUP's job base
- Contact button that allows users to contact the company that posted the job
- Filter through job listings (by area of expertise, contract duration,...)
- List all the openings to work at FEUP
- Allow the user to apply to job openings at FEUP

## Required API's

- FEUP's Jobs ([Bolsa de Emprego](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/WEB_BASE.GERA_PAGINA?P_pagina=19498))
- FEUP Internal Jobs ( [Processos de Recrutamento](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/cnt_cand_geral.concursos_list))
