#  Project Management

##  Iteration 1 - Retrospective

###  What went well?

During this iteration, the team agrees that the development of the different pages of the app itself went well, and the result is a functional app in this first release, even though some of the data is hard-coded.

###  What didn't go so well?

However, as we are not asked to develop the _backend_ of the app, the filter feature proposed in one of the user stories seemed to be impossible to implement without the needed data (which should come from that _backend_). Facing that difficulty, we tried to create a _.json_ file to be used as a mock, but even so we could not implement that feature, and the plan is to find a solution for that problem in the next itaration so that we can implement the aforementioned user story efficiently.

###  What have we learned?

Looking back at this iteration, we have mainly learned how to use many of the flutter and dart resources efficiently to build a good-looking and functional app.

###  What still puzzles us?

As already mentioned, the main difficulty encountered by the team is being able to use consistent data that allows for efficient filtering, sorting and searching actions.

##  Iteration 2 - Retrospective

###  What went well?

The team was able to implement some more pages which are essential for the app to work well. However, some user stories proposed for this iteration were not completed in time.

###  What didn't go so well?

During this iteration, the majority of the members of the team were focusing on some other projects and/or evaluations an as a result things in general did not go so well.

###  What have we learned?

Looking back at this iteration, we have learned how to make adjustements to app pages and make things more responsive.

###  What still puzzles us?

The team is still thinking of the possibility of implementing _web scraping_ to get data in real-time from the _Sigarra_ databases, and to integrate our app pages in the _Uni_ app code. Also, the backend mocks in .json are still to be implemented.

##  Iteration 3 - Retrospective

###  What went well?

The team was able to implement all the pages proposed for the app. The user stories proposed for this iteration were completed successfully and the _.json_ files that provide supoport for the backend of the app, allowing it to work dynamically even though the real backend was not provided to us. Integration with the Uni app, which provides a gateway to our app, was also implemented. Also, filters were implemented as we already had some form of backend.

###  What didn't go so well?

As this was the final iteration of the project, and we were more conversant with all the technologies used, it was easier to implement the desired functionalities, so almost everything went well. However, we would like to have implemented some sort of web scraping to get information from FEUP's job bank.

###  What have we learned?

Looking back at this iteration, we have learned how to use consistent data from  a _.json_ file using dart and flutter tools and how to integrate pages with another app.  

###  What still puzzles us?

A easy and consistent way of doing web scraping from FEUP's job bank would be really useful for solving the real-time backend problem.
